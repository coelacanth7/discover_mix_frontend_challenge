This repository is a challenge to create a website in five hours using google's material design and call an external api with AJAX to load data onto a homepage and a show page.

### Get it running

View it live on Heroku:

https://fierce-reaches-10362.herokuapp.com/

Or, assuming node and git is installed run these in order:

```
git clone https://github.com/coelacanth7/discover_mix_frontend_challenge.git
cd discover_mix_frontend_challenge
npm install
npm run start
```

### Implementation

Because of the short time span of approximately five hours I decided to use as much boilerplate code as possible to get the ball rolling.

React is my favorite framework to work with right now. Because of React's modularity and how easy it is to make AJAX requests it makes it a perfect candidate for this project. I used create-react-app to get the ball rolling and make Webpack easier.

I also used Material-UI to easily get a handle on some of the material design components.

For making AJAX calls I used the built in FetchAPI built into vanilla JavaScript

### Reflection

I feel like overall the project was a success. I got a lot done in five hours.

My biggest challenge working with Google's Material design concepts. I have never worked with these concepts so I spent the first hour researching the definition and a good implementation. Overall if I spent more time on this project I would like to implement more of these principles and components.

My biggest success is getting a fully functional React app deployed in just a few hours with no bugs.

If I spent more time I would improve the CSS and make the site more interesting to look at. I would do some image optimization, The images are larger than necessary and are taking too long to load. I would also like to add a more functional navigation bar. This is difficult to not do, but I understand the need for a metric to measure developer progress.
